# LeCoExt (Fernández-Martínez & Felices-Lago, forthcoming)
## Introduction
LeCoExt is a lexical collocate extractor tool that exploits word sketches from SketchEngine and several calculations to provide a comprehensive study of the collocational behavior of a verb or group of verbs (Fernández-Martínez & Felices-Lago, forthcoming). 
This tool can potentially facilitate the process of ontology building and refinement on the basis of the rich lexical data extracted. Further information about the practical applications of the tool can be found on Fernández-Martínez & Felices-Lago (forthcoming). There we provide the use of this tool with verbs of stealing.


## How to use this tool

For a reference on a typology of verbs, we refer the reader to, for instance, Faber & Mairal-Usón (1999).
